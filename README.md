## üîç Key Insights from EDA
- **Survival Rate**: 38.39% of passengers survived, while 61.62% perished.
- **Embarkation Port**:
  - **Cherbourg**: Highest survival rate among the ports, likely due to the higher proportion of first- and second-class passengers.
  - **Queenstown**: Higher death rate compared to survival rate, as most passengers boarding here were third-class.
  - **Southampton**: Highest death rate among all ports, as the majority of passengers boarded at this location.
- **Age**: Younger passengers had a significantly higher chance of survival. 
  - **Children (0‚Äì10 years old)**: Over 55% survived, demonstrating a priority for saving children.
  - **Young adults (20‚Äì30 years old)**: Survival rates dropped significantly, with only around 30‚Äì40% surviving.
  - **Elderly passengers (60+ years old)**: Survival rates were the lowest, with less than 20% surviving.
- **Gender**: Women (81.1% survival) were significantly more likely to survive than men (25.8% survival).
- **Family Size**: Survival rates varied significantly based on family size.
  - **Solo passengers (FamilySize = 1)**: Had the highest mortality rate, with **over 60% not surviving**.
  - **Small families (FamilySize = 2‚Äì4)**: Achieved the highest survival rates, with **50‚Äì60% surviving**.
  - **Large families (FamilySize = 5 or more)**: Experienced significantly lower survival rates, with **less than 30% surviving**.
- **Passenger Class**: Survival rates varied significantly by passenger class. 
  - **First-Class Passengers**: Enjoyed the highest survival rates, especially women, with nearly all first-class women surviving.
  - **Second-Class Passengers**: Also showed high survival rates for women, though slightly lower than first-class.
  - **Third-Class Passengers**: Both men and women faced the highest mortality rates. Women in third class had a survival rate of approximately 50%, which significantly lowered the overall survival rate for women.

## üåü Additional Observations
- **Passenger Class Distribution**: 55.1% of passengers were from 3rd class, indicating reliance on lower-class passengers for revenue.
- **Fare Disparity**: First-class fares were six times higher than third-class, showcasing the economic divide.
- **Operational Constraints**: Lifeboat shortages, financial pressures, and safety regulations contributed significantly to the disaster.
