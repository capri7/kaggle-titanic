# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## üö¢ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Titanic passenger survival using machine learning models. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes passenger details such as age, gender, class, and fare. The challenge is to identify key factors influencing survival and develop a predictive model.

## üîç Key Insights from EDA
- **Survival Rate**: 38.39% of passengers survived, while 61.62% perished.
- **Embarkation Port**:
  - **Cherbourg**: Highest survival rate among the ports, likely due to the higher proportion of first- and second-class passengers.
  - **Queenstown**: Higher death rate compared to survival rate, as most passengers boarding here were third-class.
  - **Southampton**: Highest death rate among all ports, as the majority of passengers boarded at this location.
- **Age**: Younger passengers had a significantly higher chance of survival. 
  - **Children (0‚Äì10 years old)**: Over 55% survived, demonstrating a priority for saving children.
  - **Young adults (20‚Äì30 years old)**: Survival rates dropped significantly, with only around 30‚Äì40% surviving.
  - **Elderly passengers (60+ years old)**: Survival rates were the lowest, with less than 20% surviving.
- **Gender**: Women (81.1% survival) were significantly more likely to survive than men (25.8% survival).
- **Family Size**: Survival rates varied significantly based on family size.
  - **Solo passengers (FamilySize = 1)**: Had the highest mortality rate, with **over 60% not surviving**.
  - **Small families (FamilySize = 2‚Äì4)**: Achieved the highest survival rates, with **50‚Äì60% surviving**.
  - **Large families (FamilySize = 5 or more)**: Experienced significantly lower survival rates, with **less than 30% surviving**.
- **Passenger Class**: Survival rates varied significantly by passenger class. 
  - **First-Class Passengers**: Enjoyed the highest survival rates, especially women, with nearly all first-class women surviving.
  - **Second-Class Passengers**: Also showed high survival rates for women, though slightly lower than first-class.
  - **Third-Class Passengers**: Both men and women faced the highest mortality rates. Women in third class had a survival rate of approximately 50%, which significantly lowered the overall survival rate for women.

## üåü Additional Observations
- **Passenger Class Distribution**: 55.1% of passengers were from 3rd class, indicating reliance on lower-class passengers for revenue.
- **Fare Disparity**: First-class fares were six times higher than third-class, showcasing the economic divide.
- **Operational Constraints**: Lifeboat shortages, financial pressures, and safety regulations contributed significantly to the disaster.
